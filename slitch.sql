I nearly always had help.\n\n- He\'s just being modest.\n- No, Hermione, l\'m not.\n\nFacing this stuff in real life\nis not like school.\n\nIn school, if you make a mistake,\nyou can just try again tomorrow.\n\nBut out there...\n\n...when you\'re a second away\nfrom being murdered...\n\n...or watching a friend die\nright before your eyes...\n\nYou don\'t know what that\'s like.\n\nHERMlONE:\nYou\'re right, Harry, we don\'t.\n\nThat\'s why we need your help.\n\nBecause if we\'re going to have\nany chance at beating...\n\n...Voldemort...\n\nHe\'s really back?\n\nRight. First we need to find\na place to practice...\n\n...where Umbridge won\'t find out.\n\n- The Shrieking Shack.\n- lt\'s too small.\n\n- Forbidden Forest?\n- Not bloody likely.\n\nHarry, what happens\nif Umbridge does find out?\n\nHERMlONE:\nWho cares?\n\nI mean, it\'s sort of exciting, isn\'t it,\nbreaking the rules?\n\nWho are you and what have you done\nwith Hermione?\n\nAnyway, at least we know\none positive thing that came from today.\n\nWhat\'s that?\n\nCho couldn\'t take her eyes off you,\ncould she?\n\nRight.
